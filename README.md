## Instructions

To develop push a version live you will need an account with sentry.io and google analytics. Go get accounts with them.

Copy the .env.sample to .env.development or .env.production which ever is relevant. Fill in the missing information with the codes given to you by sentry.io and google.

Install the dependencies and you're good to go. Have fun, I hope this starting point helpped you.
