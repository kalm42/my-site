title: Rick and Morty Fan Site
---
A [friend](http://completewebdesignsolution.com/) of mine and I were playing around with the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) - if you enjoy playing around with API's like I do then you should check it out. Anyway, we ended up making a fun little website that lets you search for Rick and Morty characters and see more details about them.

## Technical Details

The site was built entirely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We wanted to challenge ourselves to not use any preprocessors, bundles, libraries, or frameworks.
